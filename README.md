# bloc_interop

Proof-of-concept for using a Flutter bloc from native Android or iOS code.

(Currently works on Android but needs some improvement; coding up the iOS side.)

Set up this project as you would normally; run with `flutter run`. This is a minimal example for accessing a Flutter bloc's state from native code, as well as receiving state updates.
